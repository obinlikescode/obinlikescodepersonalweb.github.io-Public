        <h2>programming languages:</h2>
        <h3>java</h3>
        <p>i am currently enrolled in ap csa and took honors computer programming last year. 
            i have learned how to instantiate objects, 
            create classes and methods, create while loops & for loops, 
            create arrays, and the different hierarchies of classes.   </p>
            <h3>p5.js</h3>
      <p>i learned p5.js through the girls who code summer immersion program! i was given the 
        amazing opportunity to learn how to program games using this javascript library (i built 4, including one for a 
        3 day game-jam!). check out my game-jam that's in github :D
      </p>

      <h3>html & css</h3>
      <p>my experience with these two languages is interesting; i started 5 youtube tutorials and didn't 
        finish a single one! i started to take bits of information i learned from these tutorials while also 
        googling how to use these two languages in a particular situation (for example, when i want to make an image circular)
        i eventually delved into the girls who code at-home-projects where i programmed a website about enviro activism (that was my first 
        web project!)
